    <p>I don&rsquo;t remember exactly what I did when I decided I wanted to write about
what I was learning, but I found Hugo pretty quickly.</p>
<p>The idea was to have a public place for my notes to function as a sort of
second brain for myself, which I could look up in when needed. Hugo seemed
to fit the bill perfectly, being blazing fast with lots of themes to select
from. I had the vision I could just write down my notes, press a button to
publish, and I would have a beautiful page looking exactly how I wanted.</p>
<p>Enter reality.</p>
<p>While there are a lot of themes readily available, even so in just the blog
category, they did not really look like I had envisioned my blog to be. No
worries, right? Hugo is touted as being flexible and I imagined I would
quickly be able to customize it to look exactly like I wanted.</p>
<p>Enter reality, again.</p>
<p>While true that Hugo is flexible, just look at all the different themes to
see what can be achived, this turned out to be a bit of a rabbit hole. Looking
at the documentation, I was quickly to exposed to things I had never heard
about before, like &ldquo;front-matter&rdquo; and &ldquo;taxonomy&rdquo;. In due time I will probably
look into learning more about this, maybe I need to write my own theme to be
satisfied, but it is not my priority now. I ended up spending more time than I
wanted on this, but with some small changes here and there I was able to make
it look good enough for now. This is no critique of the theme I am using, by
no means, it just wasn&rsquo;t exactly what I had hoped.</p>
<p>For starters there are
certain things regarding dates I want to change. The &ldquo;published&rdquo; date is
actually the time and date the file was created. Now I can change this
manually, but I had hoped it would automatically set the time and date when I
pressed the button to publish the post.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Updated&rdquo; is last time the file was
written to, so a completely new post will have both of those times shown,
even though I don&rsquo;t really consider the post to be updated. I want updated to
be if I go in and edit the post after it has been published, which I guess I
have to set manually.</p>
<p>I also want a small area for a sort of change log
explaining why I updated the post and what was changed. Then I might also want
to change the styling a little more than I have already done, but like I said,
this is not where I want to spend my time right now.</p>
<p>I guess someone might want to mention Wordpress right now, but I don&rsquo;t know
anything about it. As I have my own server and can look at the access logs,
I see constant scanning from bots trying to access Wordpress pages, which I
guess are looking for known vulnerabilities. I&rsquo;m under the impression that
there has been a lot of security vulnerabilities with Wordpress, so that
excludes the topic for me, even if it had the perfect solution I first dreamed
about.</p>
<p>All in all I am mostly satisfied with what I&rsquo;ve learnt and seen so far. Hugo
was fairly easy to install, the same was the themes. Hugo also delivers on
speed, the entire site builds in milliseconds. I also like that it is written
in Go since I&rsquo;ve been exposed a little to the go language already through
Caddy server and Goaccess. If you want to do something with the template
engine in Caddy, it will sometimes refer to the Golang documentation and it
seems similar to writing a theme in Hugo.</p>
<p>But as has been mentioned, I don&rsquo;t want to do a deep dive into this right now,
my main idea was to focus on coding. There is just so much it is possible to
learn about, so much I think is interesting and want to know more about as
well, but it can be considered a bit of procrastination for now.</p>
<p>I think I&rsquo;ll create a page with the rabbit holes/timesinks I want to get back
to later.</p>
