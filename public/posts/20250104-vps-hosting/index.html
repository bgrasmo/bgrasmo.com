  Introduction
  <a href="#introduction">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I am using a VPS, a Virtual Private Server, hosted by someone other than the
big cloud providers like Amazon and Google for a couple of reasons. First
of all I only looked at Amazon and Google briefly, and didn&rsquo;t really
understand their offering. I realized later that I should have looked in the
&ldquo;compute&rdquo; category, and not their entire product catalogue to find what I
wanted, but that is another story. The second reason is cost, or more
correctly, predictability of cost.</p>
<p>With the more traditional VPS providers, you normally pay for usage per the
hour up to a given max, which is the specified monthly cost. So you get the
benefit of only paying for what you use, if you spin up a server for only a
couple of days to test something you only pay for those hours, but you also
only pay the max amount of the plan should you forget to turn it off again.
Another benefit is that if something happens like a process running wild and
hogging all the available CPU, you still only pay the monthly cost for the
plan. Now you might get your plan cancelled or available CPU throttled if it
happens a lot, but the cost is given.</p>
<p>The exception is outgoing bandwidth of which there is normally a given amount
included in the plan. It should for most cases be sufficient, it is for sure
for my low traffic pages, but obviously your needs are probably different from
mine. If you exceed whatever outgoing amount is included, it seems 1000 GB or
1 TB is standard, then you will have to pay for the extra usage. Fortunately
data usage is not prohibitively expensive, for Digitalocean it is currently
$10 per extra terrabyte of outgoing data, so you&rsquo;re probably not going to get
a surprise bill of thousands or even tens of thousands of dollars one month.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="digitalocean">
  Digitalocean
  <a href="#digitalocean">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The provider I have the most experience with is <a href="https://digitalocean.com/">Digitalocean</a>.
They have a decent amount of physical locations, and it&rsquo;s nice to get one
close to you to reduce lag when SSH&rsquo;ing into it. They mostly support Linux now
unfortunately, and are a little more expensive than other providers, but in my
experience they provided a very stable service with no downtime. Another
advantage is their cloud firewall which you can put in front of your server,
so most of the persistent bot scans for open ports and services never reaches
your server. I used them when they supported FreeBSD, but they unfortunately
stopped supporting it in 2022. If you had a FreeBSD server with them at that
time you could continue running it though, and can still today, but they don&rsquo;t
let you install FreeBSD on a new droplet. (At least not easily.)</p>
<p>Another advantage is that you can quickly spin up a server in one of their
locations, delete it when not needed and only pay for the time it was running.</p>
<p>One disadvantage of Digitalocean is that they don&rsquo;t support IPv6 properly. Yes
you can get IPv6 addresses from them, but you only get 10 addresses! The
standard for IPv6 is that a /64, or 18,446,744,073,709,551,616 addresses is the
minimal allocation, however wasteful that might seem. Normally you would be
assigned something like this: <code>2a03:1234:5678:9abc::/64</code> which we can expand
to this for the addresses you can use:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>From: 2a03:1234:5678:9abc:0000:0000:0000:0000
To:   2a03:1234:5678:9abc:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff
</code></pre><p>And anything in between those. See how the first four groups of numbers are
the same? They are considered one subnet, and the smallest one in IPv6, so
anything after that is normally up to you to use however you like.</p>
<p>This has a practical disadvantage if using Docker for instance. Docker has
quite strict limits on how many images you can pull down per day if you are
not logged in and are not a paying customer. In order to identify you when you
are not logged in they use your IP address. Can you see where this is going
yet? Given &ldquo;everyone&rdquo; considers anything starting with <code>2a03:1234:5678:9abc:</code>
to be the same customer, while Digitalocean uses <code>2a03:1234:5678:9abc:</code> for
all their customers, you probably won&rsquo;t be able to pull docker images using
IPv6 on Digitalocean, as resource limits have been exhausted by someone else
already. The solution then is to either create and account and log in, or
only pull images with IPv4. And to be absolutely correct, they don&rsquo;t have one
/64 for <strong>all</strong> their customers, but probably one /64 per site. But still. It
might be nit-picking, but I was surprised to learn about this and experienced
the consequence of it myself.</p>
<p>I digress. Back to VPS hosting providers.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="hetzner">
  Hetzner
  <a href="#hetzner">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The provider I am using is <a href="https://hetzner.com/">Hetzner</a>. They are quite
strict about who can become their customer, as is their perogative. I think
that is nice as it keeps the abusers out and it lets them provide a very good
and stable service cheaper than others. On Digitalocean I can get a single AMD
CPU, 1GB RAM, 25 GB disk and 1TB transfer for $7 a month. (Taxes will be added
to that if applicable.) On Hetzner I can get 2 AMD CPUs, 2GB RAM, 40 GB disk
and 20TB transfer (!) for €4.35/month. Again taxes will be added to that
if applicable. Hetzner also has the option to not have an IPv4 address and
save €0.5/month if you don&rsquo;t need it. They also gives you a full /64 IPv6
subnet to use, avoiding the docker problems I experienced on Digitalocean.</p>
<p>Hetzner also provides a cloud firewall, preventing all unwanted traffic from
reaching your server. I log everything that reaches closed ports on my server
and for both Digitalocean and Hetzner, those logs are empty. Nice!</p>
<p>Hetzner is also extremely stable, and I&rsquo;ve experience no downtime for the 4
months or so I&rsquo;ve been a customer there. My server has obviously been down
during those 4 months, but that is my own doing due to kernel updates or
similar.</p>
<p>Hetzner has the same advatange as Digitalocean in that you can quickly spin up
a server to test something, take it down again and only pay for the time you
had it running.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="openbsdamsterdam">
  OpenBSD.Amsterdam
  <a href="#openbsdamsterdam">#</a>
</h2>
<p>If you are interested in running something other than Linux I can recommend
OpenBSD. They probably have the best man-pages of all for one thing and given
their focus on security, I also feel a little more confident experimenting
with different services when using OpenBSD.</p>
<p>Enter <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam/">OpenBSD.Amsterdam</a></p>
<p>They specialize in OpenBSD and basically only have one plan where you get 1
CPU, 1 GB RAM and 50 GB disk for €69/year. Network usage is unlimited, but
fair-share, so be nice to your neighbours! You can get extra RAM or disk by
paying extra for it.</p>
<p>What might be considered a disadvantage is that you have to pay for a full
year up front, so if you just want to try OpenBSD and see if it is for you
this might not be the service to try.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage is that OpenBSD feels kind of slow to use and software
support is limited. Do you want to try <a href="https://bun.sh/">bun</a> for instance?
Good luck with that! Zig, which is the language Bun is built in is not very
well supported on OpenBSD and so trying to compile things was way over my
head.</p>
<p>Want to try something a little less experimental, like <a href="https://deno.com">Deno</a>?
At the time of this writing, Deno 2 has been out for quite a while, but the
latest package in OpenBSD is version 1.45.5. If you want another version you
have to try and compile it yourself.</p>
<p>Even <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Nodejs</a>
is not well supported with only version 20.17 being available. Want to use
<code>nvm</code> to manage Node installations? Well, OpenBSD isn&rsquo;t supported as a compile-target
for Node officially, so you have to try and compile another version
yourself. Your mileage may vary of course, but I was not able to do it. While
you obviously can run Node 20.17 on OpenBSD, it feels kind of sluggish
compared to running it on Linux, where it feels &ldquo;snappy&rdquo;, meaning starting
and responding immediately. I&rsquo;ve performed the same task on OpenBSD and
similarly specced Ubuntu Linux server, which was to read and parse some text
files and insert the data into a sqlite3 database. On my OpenBSD server it
took 2 minutes real time, while on Ubuntu it took around 40 seconds. So that&rsquo;s
what I mean when I say OpenBSD feels a little slow to use.</p>
<p>Also, is OpenBSD really more secure than other operating systems? Some might
disagree, see <a href="https://isopenbsdsecu.re/">this</a> for more information. My
personal guess is that it definately is more obscure, and what I&rsquo;ve seen is
that software written to be secure on OpenBSD isn&rsquo;t really portable to other
operating systems, given their own special sauce way of doing things. <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pledge.2">Pledge</a>
for instance, which is a system call used to state what system calls the
program use and need access to, which means other (dangerous) system calls
won&rsquo;t be available to the program. It is a good thing, for sure, but if it
only exists on OpenBSD, programs making use of it can&rsquo;t easily run on other
operating systems.</p>
<p>OpenBSD comes with something called <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd</a> which
is used to accept incomming connections, do filtering, and then forward the
connection to their destination. This is needed if you want to use OpenBSD
<a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd</a> to serve web-pages and set headers
like CSP in the response, as httpd does not support setting said headers
itself. I&rsquo;ve found this combination works quite well, though the same can
probably be achived with just nginx. I have not tried to use Caddy with
OpenBSD, as it looks less supported than nginx which seems to <a href="https://obsd.solutions/en/blog/2022/02/18/openbsd-httpd-70-web-server/">have been supported</a>
a while ago.</p>
<p>On the positive side, OpenBSD.Amsterdam provide the best console experience of
them all, or at least I think so! You access the console of your server by
SSH&rsquo;ing into the host, which also runs OpenBSD by the way, and then use <code>cu</code>
to access it. Other providers mostly have a web-console where you have to
access the console from their web pages.</p>
<p>OpenBSD.Amsterdam also provide a very stable service. You can
see their server CPU and network graphs <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam/servers.html">here</a>
and that also shows their servers uptime. Looking at the OpenBSD <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/errata76.html">errata</a>
page, there aren&rsquo;t many issues at all, and so there is no need to reboot to
update. They recently, on 2024-12-29 updated from OpenBSD 7.5 to 7.6 which is
why the uptime is so low now. Before the update it was 220+ days.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="1984hosting">
  1984.hosting
  <a href="#1984hosting">#</a>
</h2>
<p><a href="https://1984.hosting/">1984.hosting</a> is a provider located in Iceland, focused
on powering their service using only green energy as well as having a
particular focus on privacy. They mainly provide various Linux distributions
out of the box, but once you get your server installed, you can go to the
recovery options and choose a number of other operating systems, like OpenBSD.</p>
<p>You will have to pay for the full month up front, and located in Iceland, the
latency to them was a little high for me so that is why I&rsquo;m not using their
services anymore. (The lag in SSH was noticable.) The 3-4 months I had a
server there however, it was perfectly stable.</p>
<p>There was something a little strange with the Ubuntu mirror they had set up
as default though. On July 1st when the news of a remote SSH vulnerability
broke, there were no updates from said mirror. Checking the Ubuntu mirror
pages, the mirror had supposedly been checked only a few hours ago, and was
said to be up to date. This persisted for days. I got no response whatsoever
from neither 1984 themselves, nor the people managing the mirror. I resolved
the issue by switching to a different mirror, but found it disconcerning that
Ubuntu supposedly checks their mirrors, says they are ok and up to date, while
they really aren&rsquo;t. Especially when it comes to security updates! I did check
the mirror manually many times and could confirm it didn&rsquo;t have the latest
openssh packages available.</p>
<p>The last part is maybe not so much the fault of 1984.hosting, but again they
had selected a local mirror that wasn&rsquo;t being updated and did not respond when
asked about it.</p>
<p>Another thing to note is that to cancel the service, per their terms they
require at least 16 days notice before the service would be renwed, with a
mail with a given subject sent to their billing address. The service will then
be shut down when the period you have paid for ends.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="lowendtalk">
  Lowendtalk
  <a href="#lowendtalk">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Moving on to perhaps more alternative territory, I discovered a page called
<a href="https://lowendtalk.com/categories/offers">Lowendtalk</a> which is a forum for
various companies offering VPS services. What they have in common is that
their services are very cheap, some even extremely so. From this page I
managed to get a deal for a 1 CPU, 1GB RAM, 10 GB disk for only €5 for a whole
year! Yes, that is less than €0.5 per month! Sure, it isn&rsquo;t fast and disk is
limited, but it is located in one of the Hetzner datacentres and has been
100% stable since I got it a couple of months ago. While I won&rsquo;t use it for
anything &ldquo;serious&rdquo;, it is perfect for experimenting with.</p>
<p>Be aware when buying anything here though, as terms vary wildly and support
staff, if there even is any, also varies a lot. One server I bought went down
a mere 12 hours after I set it up, and the provider was not aware. It was not
untill I, and probably a few others, pestered them about it that they noticed
they had a hardware failure and moved us over to a different node. So for my
first 24 hours of being a customer of this company, my service had been down
for 12 hours, or only 50% uptime. It has been perfectly stable since then
though so I was just unlucky with the box. Their support is extremely slow,
and they keep claiming they have a huge number of tickets to go through, which
I consider a bit of a red flag. If their services were stable, and they had
decent self-support pages, I don&rsquo;t think they would be overloaded with tickets.</p>
<p>With another provider I tried I experienced 3 crashes during the first 14
days, each leading to catastrophic disk corruption so I had to rebuild my
server from scratch each time. Accoring to their terms they provide no
uptime guarantee (!), not even a measly 95% or even 90%, so in theory they
could let me install the server then shut it down and run away with my money.
They wouldn&rsquo;t be in business if they did that though, but just be aware you
have no guarantees of the service actually being available when you want/need
it.</p>
<p>These providers also seem to be provided by people working a regular 9-5, so
if anything happens outside those hours, you&rsquo;ll have to wait for support.</p>
<p>Having said all that though, you can get some fantastic deals here, so if you
just want something to experiment with, I don&rsquo;t think you can do better. Given
you can get a quite powerful server for maybe only $15 total for a whole year,
I&rsquo;m not sure I have much grounds to complain.</p>
<p>So I&rsquo;m not naming any names here, I don&rsquo;t want to shame anyone as I could just
have been unlucky, and like I said, you can get a server extremely cheap.
Just do your due dilligence, read their terms, see other peoples experiences
in their threads and decide what is good enough for you.</p>
<p>To finish this post I can share a youtube video I came across titled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-9KWQByeU0">Setting up a production ready VPS is a lot easier than I though</a>
by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@dreamsofcode">Dreams of Code</a>. He&rsquo;s followed up with
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuZoxuBiL9o">docker stack is my new favorite way to deploy to a VPS</a>
both of which I think is useful.</p>
