    <div class="single-content">
      <p>When I installed Linux on my desktop in the beginning of May in 2021, I
selected Ubuntu for reasons I can no longer remember. It may have been
because it was the only one I had heard about, that it was considered
easy to use, was considered stable, had lots of packages available, I
don&rsquo;t know.</p>
<p>Not knowing better I installed the latest version available at the time,
21.04 (Hirsute Hippo), which I learned later was not an LTS release.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember my exact upgrade path, nor is it very interesting.
I do remember Ubuntu not upgrading to the latest version, which may have
been caused by me not following LTS from the start but I learnt a little
about Ubuntu in the process and how to switch between release tracks.
(See files in /etc/update-manager)</p>
<p>I also experienced an issue where I could no longer upgrade packages because
I had somehow gotten a package conflict. That annoyed me a little as all I
had done was upgrade the packages when the upgrade pop-up came and install
some new one I needed. I don&rsquo;t remember if it went away on its own or if I
fixed it myself, but in any case, life went on.</p>
<p>I ended up running 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish) for quite a while as I was happy
with everything and it was an LTS release so it would be supported for a long
time. Then when 24.04 appeared and the upgrade pop-ups began appearing, I
started considering upgrading.</p>
<p>However, it came with an &ldquo;annoying&rdquo; &ldquo;make sure you have backups of your data&rdquo;
message that made me pause. Although it would probably be fine, with the other
upgrades I had done I had not experienced any problems, I didn&rsquo;t want to chance
it this time. I had gotten used to my setup and had files I wanted to keep,
but wasn&rsquo;t the best at making a backup of everything.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;a new release is available&rdquo; kept coming from time to time, and the most
annoying thing about that and &ldquo;new software, want to update?&rdquo; pop-ups was
that they take keyboard focus when they appear. I think that&rsquo;s a pretty bad
default! It would happen from time to time that as I was typing away, one
of the pop-ups would appear, take keyboard focus, and I had suddenly started
or declined an update before I could even read what the box said. Fortunately
the system-upgrade pop-up required my password afterwards, so I could cancel
it if activated by mistake.</p>
<p>Time went on, until I finally decided to make sure I had good backups of
everything just a little while ago. A chore, which was nice to get done even
though I could have lived well with a data loss, it would just be nicer to
not have it. Then I felt ready to silence the Ubuntu upgrade warnings.</p>
<p>So I took the plunge and installed Fedora 42.</p>
<p>I wanted to do a full reinstall to set everything up from scratch, get rid
of old stuff that had accumulated over time and just basically start fresh.
Having learnt about Fedora, I was enticed by their 6 month upgrade cycle
as well as software being a little more up to date than on Ubuntu. Fedora
for instance seems to be more aggressive with updating the kernel to newer
versions, which I think can be beneficial.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="issues-incomming">
  Issues incomming
  <a class="anchor" href="#issues-incomming">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I am not a die-hard or hard-core Linux user as is probably evident, so I&rsquo;m
not actually sure what desktop environment Ubuntu use, but I guess it is
gnome. I know Fedora uses gnome, and it feels fairly similar to Ubuntu. There
are however some differences and maybe also new annoyances.</p>
<p>The screenshots I had seen of Fedora desktop beforehand all looked nice, and
crucially, I think they all had a dock, the place where you have easy access
to your favorite or most used programs. When I started Fedora, the dock was
indeed shown at the bottom of the screen and there was also a search-field
at the top of the screen. The background image doesn&rsquo;t fill the screen but is
made smaller, possibly to indicate that there are multiple desktops. All okay-ish
so far. However, if I click the desktop, the search-field goes away, the dock goes
away, and the background image fills the screen. All of it, so there is nothing
to see other than the background image&hellip;</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="dock-issues">
  Dock issues
  <a class="anchor" href="#dock-issues">#</a>
</h2>
<p>I found that by moving the mouse pointer to the top-left corner of the screen
I could get this mode back, and again see the dock. However it was not very user-friendly
to me, having to first go to top-left corner, then to the bottom to start
a program. Right out of the bat here I feel I&rsquo;ve made the wrong choice as this is
something I won&rsquo;t be able to live with. Some searching and I learned that there is
something called &ldquo;the super key&rdquo; I can press to enter this mode and not have to
point in top-left corner. That helps a little, but it still irks me as it&rsquo;s not
how I&rsquo;m used to working.</p>
<p>Searching further, I learn that there is indeed a way to have the dock stay on
your desktop permanently. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ufbg-S2B8F8">This video</a> was made using Fedora 40
but it still works in Fedora 42 fortunately. I must say, the video is excellent
and provides very detailed steps on what to do, detailing both what to do if
you&rsquo;re doing this for the first time or you&rsquo;ve already done some of it, making
it very easy to follow along! Hats of to you, Techmimic!</p>
<p>The process in brief includes installing the &ldquo;gnome-extensions-app&rdquo; package with
dnf, opening the &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; app and activating it, opening a browser and going
to &ldquo;extensions.gnome.org&rdquo;, searching for &ldquo;dash to dock&rdquo;, turning it on and
selecting install. Now the dock will be permanently visible at the bottom of the
screen. Yes you read that correctly, you have to install a browser extension to control
your desktop. I am quite surprised to put it mildly. To configure the dock, search
for the &ldquo;extensions&rdquo; program again, and select the 3 dots next to dash to dock.
However strange that felt I can now mimic the Ubuntu dock so I&rsquo;m happy.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="browser-issues">
  Browser issues
  <a class="anchor" href="#browser-issues">#</a>
</h2>
<p>The next hurdle was that my browser of choice, Brave, was not very performant.
Clicking on a tab it would take around two seconds before it actually switched
to that tab. More searching and I learnt that by going to brave://flags which
contains experimental features, there is something called &ldquo;preferred ozone
plattform&rdquo; which should be set to &ldquo;wayland&rdquo;. All right, that seems to have fixed
the browser issues so I&rsquo;m starting to think this is something I can user after all.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="terminal-issues">
  Terminal issues
  <a class="anchor" href="#terminal-issues">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Another hurdle was that my preferred terminal emulator, WezTerm did not start.
Or rather, it started but crashed immediately. Searching revealed that I should
add <code>config.enable_wayland = false</code> to the configuration, and that seems to help.
However, after I&rsquo;ve installed the font I use (Intel One Mono) and pulled in the
rest of my configuration, it turns out that option is no longer needed so I don&rsquo;t
know what was going on there. But it works now so I am happy.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="vlc-issues">
  VLC issues
  <a class="anchor" href="#vlc-issues">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Next was my preferred video player which is VLC. I had some issues with that on
Ubuntu where it didn&rsquo;t have all the necessary codecs, but those were easy to
find and install. On Fedora however, VLC seems to work as it plays audio, but
the picture is black. Looking at media information it has identified the right
codec, H.264, so everything looked fine. It seems like codecs for this is
installed as well. Searching does not turn up much help either, others have
experienced the same, but there was not much with regards to a conclusive
solution. I followed many things others had done that fixed it for them, but it
did not help for me. I discovered rpmfusion and installed stuff from there, both
free and non free to no avail. Many times I would also get the result &ldquo;already
installed&rdquo; of things that was suggested to install. I tried countless configuration
changes in VLC as well, regarding input, output and what not, but nothing helped.</p>
<p>Many suggestions said something about broken media file, but I knew that was not
the case. A video from my phone that worked on Ubuntu wouldn&rsquo;t play. Even videos
from the built-in video recorder (shift-ctrl-alt-r) wouldn&rsquo;t play back. This was
the most frustrating experience so far. What finally solved it for me was installing
a package called &ldquo;libavcodec-freeworld&rdquo;. I don&rsquo;t know if this alone fixed everything
or if some of the previous steps I completed is also necessary, but I&rsquo;m not going
to try to reproduce this. So unfortunately I can&rsquo;t provide any better explanations
than others have tried to give.</p>
<p>VLC has one strange quirk on Fedora when it starts where it will fill most of the screen,
pause for 2-3 seconds, and then fill the screen completely. I don&rsquo;t know what is
going on there, it&rsquo;s just strange, and not something that happened on Ubuntu.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="intermission">
  Intermission
  <a class="anchor" href="#intermission">#</a>
</h2>
<p>&ldquo;This is what Linux is about&rdquo;, you might say, &ldquo;you can configure everything exactly
the way you want!&rdquo; That may very well be, but that is not for me. I came accross a
reddit post the other day that formulates this nicer than I could:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linuxquestions/comments/1ksug1g/is_there_an_end_game_with_linux/">Is there an end game with Linux?</a></p>
<p>Two things from the post resonated with me in particular:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;After several days, my concern is that Linux might just be a
never ending hobby instead of a tool that can be configured and
then used.&#34;
</code></pre><p>And</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&#34;Is there a point where I can just use the computer to complete
tasks or is the computer always going to BE THE TASK?&#34;
</code></pre><p>I can live with doing some configuration, if you&rsquo;ve read this far you can tell
I have figured out how to fix the issues most critical to me, but it is
something I&rsquo;d rather not have to spend much time on. Having Linux or an
operating system as hobby is not productive to me.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="more-gnome-issues">
  More Gnome issues
  <a class="anchor" href="#more-gnome-issues">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Another thing I felt was missing was the minimize and maximize icons usually
found at the top left or right of the program windows. Maximize wasn&rsquo;t that
critical as I know I can double-click the title-bar to maximize the window,
but I needed a minimize icon as I use that quite a lot. Turns out it&rsquo;s time
to install yet another program, this one called <code>gnome-tweaks</code>. It was
fortunately just a <code>sudo dnf install</code> command away, but I am curious why
these configurations aren&rsquo;t all available in the same program, or a package
of programs if need be.</p>
<p>Anyway, I finally got the desktop set up the way I wanted, and I am hoping
this is it. Like I said above, tweaking, fixing and investigating the operating
system and desktop I am running I don&rsquo;t consider to be productive use of time,
and it is not something I find particularily fun either. It&rsquo;s a chore that has
to be done before we get to the good stuff, which is actually using this thing.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="a-positive">
  A positive
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-positive">#</a>
</h2>
<p>This has been a little negative this far, but there are some positives as well.
The upgrade notifications are <strong>a lot better!</strong> I get a toast notification if
there is something critical I should update, otherwise I can go into the software
app and check the upgrades tab. This is a lot less intrusive than Ubuntu, and the
way I think it should be handled! Though I haven&rsquo;t used Fedora long enough to
experience what happens when the next release comes out.</p>
<p>It also seems that the screen is a little crisper with Fedora. I&rsquo;m not sure why
that is, it just seems a little sharper and more clear to me.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="a-final-negative">
  A final negative
  <a class="anchor" href="#a-final-negative">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Fedora seems to be accessing the disk a lot more than Ubuntu did. Now I know I&rsquo;m
looking at this with fresh eyes as it is new to me, but I&rsquo;m fairly confident
Ubuntu was gentler to the disk. On Ubuntu, I do believe I had started all my programs,
like the terminal, code editor and browser with multiple tabs open, and let it just
sit there a little while, there was not much disk activity. On Fedora
in the same situation, the disk-light ticks regularly every 5 seconds or so. It
will also from time to time tick a lot on and off without me doing anything.</p>
<p>I have 32 GB RAM which really is overkill for my needs, and <code>top</code> tells me only 6 GB RAM
is used so the disk usage does not come from swapping. The culprit seems to be the
browser, or that at least seems to be one of the causes, but why it needs to access the
disk a lot on Fedora while being idle, but it did not need thaton Ubuntu is beyond me.</p>
<p>Given I have an SSD, I am wondering about wear and tear from all this extra activity,
so I am contemplating going back to Ubuntu to check if I misremember things or if
there really is a difference. There&rsquo;s obviously a chance the newer versions of everything
might come in to play here, and that the latest version of Ubuntu would be no better, but
I don&rsquo;t know. I am also aware that I&rsquo;m watching everything more closely as &ldquo;everything&rdquo; is
new, so it might mean I am noticing things that were the same on Ubuntu I just didn&rsquo;t
notice it.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="just-one-more-thing">
  Just one more thing
  <a class="anchor" href="#just-one-more-thing">#</a>
</h2>
<p>Sound will sometime blast at full volume, even though the volume slider is at 50%. Nudging
it a little fixes it. It&rsquo;s not terrible, but it is annoying and I find it quite strange.
What setting somewhere is not being set, or is ignored or whatever?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve also noticed that there&rsquo;s something about what fonts are being shown in the browser.
There seems to be more serif-type fonts now, while I believe Ubuntu had more sans-serif.
I could of course be something I&rsquo;ve done over the years, some font-pack I&rsquo;ve installed
and forgotten about, but it&rsquo;s just another one of those things.</p>
<p>Then finally, alt-tab seems to work differently where it only shows the program icons,
like Mac does. I believe Ubuntu showed window previews, like Windows does, which I find
a lot more useful. Given I have multiple browser windows open, the Windows way allows me
to find the one I want quicker.
There seems to be something with the window handling in general on Fedora compared to
Ubuntu. Given the case with multiple open browser windows, right-clicking on the browser
icon in the dock gives me a menu where I will have to click &ldquo;all windows&rdquo; to see all the
open browser windows. I believe Ubuntu let me do the same with less clicks, but I can&rsquo;t
remember exactly.</p>
<h2 class="heading" id="conclusion">
  Conclusion
  <a class="anchor" href="#conclusion">#</a>
</h2>
<p>To me it feels like Ubuntu does things better out of the box with mostly better defaults.
The browser just worked, VLC clearly told me it was missing codecs and they were easy
to find and install, there never was any issues with the volume, the minimize/maximize
icons were there by default, as were the dock and so on.</p>
<p>Like I said before, it could be that I scrutinize things more closely now given this is
a fresh install, or it could simply be due to newer versions of everything, I don&rsquo;t know.
I am tempted to go back to Ubuntu and check if I just remember everything wrong or if it
just suited me better than Fedora. It seems that Ubuntu might be a little more aggressive
with upgrading kernels for instance going forward, which I think is a good thing. Also
knowing what I know now I might just upgrade to the interrim releases as well.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a learning experience, but like I&rsquo;ve also said already, I don&rsquo;t want Linux to
have to be a hobby for me now, I want it to just be there and work and let me focus on
other things.</p>
